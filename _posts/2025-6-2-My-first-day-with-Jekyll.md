Today I learn about Using Jekyll to set up a static site.

I still need to learn out to incorporate LaTex of some kind, to be able to write in some mathematics. Usually [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is the solution in my experience - it's very useful. I firsted learnt about it when trying to make [Anki](https://www.mathjax.org/) cards during my physics degree. Ultimately, paper flashcards won out in the end. 

I'd like to use Obsidian for writing these documents, so I'll likely copy my posts from there to my github. I think I'll automate that, so I might make a post showing how I'll do it. It'll be some simple batch script, similar to one I used to implement a cloud sync for Obsidian, without using [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync).

I do feel very refreshed being able to write to a site using markdown, having been an avid [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) user for the last couple of months. 

Hopefully many more posts to come!

```Python

    def bye(person):
        print(f"Bye, {person}, have a nice day!")


    bye("Visitor")
